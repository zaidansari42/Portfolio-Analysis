      "description": "While returns are important, evaluating a strategy requires looking at risk-adjusted metrics. This post covers essential measures like Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, volatility, and max drawdown to help investors make more informed decisions about performance. We also explain how these metrics complement each other, revealing insights that raw returns alone cannot provide. Case studies show how a strategy with lower raw returns but better risk-adjusted performance can outperform over the long term, reinforcing the importance of considering both gains and the risks taken to achieve them."
